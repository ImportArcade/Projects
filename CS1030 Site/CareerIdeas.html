    <h1>CS Career Ideas</h1>
    <h2>Video Game Programmer</h2>
    <p>Ever since I was a kid I've wanted to go into the video game industry one way or another. Growing up I was told not to do that, until I learned about computer science and programming.  Video Game programmers work very closely with other members of the game making process by creating game engines and programming what game developers want implemented into the game. Typically a bachelor's degree or higher is required to be a video game programmer. One company I've always wanted to work for is Nintendo. I've played Nintendo games since I was a kid, so working there would be a dream come true. </p>

    <h2>Software Developer</h2>
    <p>Software Developers, AKA Software Engineers, created programs and software for clients that can make whatever the client is trying to do significantly easier. Software Developers use programming languages, data structures, and UI building to create a software that is easy for users to navigate and, well, use. Like with Game Programmers, Software Developers typically need a bachelor's degree or above to get a decent job.</p>

    <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
    <p>Cyber Security is a broad spectrum of jobs. Most jobs in Cyber Security often include detecing features in a software, networ, or server that are insecure and then securing them through many different means. Cyber Security specialists use the OSI model and TCP/IP model extremely often due to the fact that insecurities could like anywhere on said models. Cyber Security, much like the last two careers, require at least a Bachelor's degree and other certifications.</p>
