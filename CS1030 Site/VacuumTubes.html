    <h1>A Very Brief History of Vacuum Tubes</h1>

    <p>In this day and age the  term "Vacuum Tubes" is foreign to most people. I've always been interested in vacuum tubes and after learning about how many vacuum tubes were necessary for the first computer, I wanted to learn more about why so many tubes were necessary. The first vacuum tube was invented by a man named John Ambrose Fleming in 1904 and he utilized a very interesting byproduct of the lightbulb.</p>
    <p>From the video provided in the "History of Computing" module I learned that the idea for vacuum tubes essentially came from the little black debris found in old lightbulbs. This black debris is caused by something called "Thermionic Emission." This phenomena occurs when the electrons that are thrown out of the filament of the lightbulb don't have anything positively charged to attach to. By utilizing Thermionic Emission, John Ambrose Fleming was able to create the Thermionic Valve, otherwise known as the vacuum tube. </p>
    <p>Although John Ambrose Fleming is considered to be the inventor of the vacuum tube, the Supreme Court ended up rescinding his patent.  They claimed that "the technology he used for his invention was already known."(Long, T., 2009) His diode vacuum tube would be essential in radios, television sets, and computers to name a few. Fleming's work was so integral in the world of technology he was knighted in 1929 and awarded the Medal of Honor by the Institute of Radio Engineers. Fleming's invention of the vacuum tube is no longer in use today because of the invention of the capacitor, integrated circuit, and more. That doesn't mean that Fleming's work is obsolete. His invention paved the way for modern computers and technology.</p>
