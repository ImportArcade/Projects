    <h2>What is Ransomware?</h2>
    <p>Ransomeware is a type of virus that hackers use to make immediate money off of victims. The virus can come in different shapes and sizes. One specific type of ransomware is used to completely lock a user out of their device. Hackers want the user to pay the ransom for their computer, and in turn they will give the key to unlocking their computer. Another type of ransomware can be used to lock a user out of certain files on their device, and the end goal for hackers is the same.</p>
    <h2>How to prevent ransomware:</h2>
    <p>There are a number of ways that users can protect themselves from and prevent a ransomware attack. One of the easiest ways to do this is to keep the device and software up-to-date at all times. Updates increase the security in a device or software and happen often which makes it difficult for hackers to get into the device itself. Another way is to always have files backed up. Files can be backed up in the coud, on a server, or on an external hard drive. If a user's files are attacked by ransomware, the user can shut down the computer and still have their files protected.</p>
    <h2>What to do in case of a ransomeware attack:</h2>
    <p>If a ransomeware attack does happen there are alternatives to paying the ransom. If a user has their files backed up as previously mentioned, the easiest thing to do would be to just factory reset the device. Resetting the device in this way will completely wipe everything from the device, including the ransomware virus. Now, if the user's device isn't completely locked out, the user should disconnect from the internet and use a ransomware decryption tool to find the ransomware and delete it. Hackers are getting more and more clever everyday, but these few tools, and many more, can save a user from a ransomware attack.</p>
